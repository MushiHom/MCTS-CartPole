# MCTS-CartPole
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a policy optimization algorithm in the OpenAI Gym CartPole environment. It showcases how MCTS can be used to improve action selection in reinforcement learning by performing tree-based simulations to explore optimal policies.
