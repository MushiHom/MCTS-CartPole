# Monte Carlo Tree Search for Policy Optimization in CartPole-v1

## Description
This project presents a basic implementation of **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for **policy optimization** in reinforcement learning. MCTS is applied to the **CartPole-v1** environment, where it explores and selects the best actions by simulating future outcomes through tree-based search.

## Features
- Implements a **Node-based MCTS structure** for tracking game states and rewards.
- Uses **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula** to balance exploration and exploitation.
- Performs **rollouts and backpropagation** to refine policy optimization.
- Evaluates performance using **reward tracking and moving average plots**.
